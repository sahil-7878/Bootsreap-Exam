                        Our interview process typically involves two to three stages. The first stage is usually a phone or
                        video interview with a recruiter to assess your background, qualifications, and fit for the role. 
                        If you proceed to the second stage, you'll have an in-person or virtual interview with the hiring
                        manager and possibly team members, where we will dive deeper into your skills and experience. For
                        certain roles, you may be asked to complete a skills assessment or task.
